# RGB-Time

Have you ever wondered what time it is in RGB? No, me neither, actually.

Take a look at the most recent version on [Netlify](https://rgb-time.netlify.app/ "RGB-Time")

## Why?

I'm currently learning the ins and outs of web development and I knew, I have to start getting some practical experience at some point. I thought quite awhile about what "useful" thing I can build as my first small project. Then I watched this video: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY "Why you should make useless things | Simone Giertz") and it inspired me, to think of something not quite as useful.

## The goals

- Build a site, with a slow changing background-color
- I want to make it a static site, but still allow everyone in the world to see the same color at the same time
- Show the current color as RGB in the center
- Make it possible to copy the current color, so you can use it for designs, if you see one you like

## Why typescript?

After getting into advanced stuff of js, I found out about typescript and really liked it. So I decided to use it in my project going forward. Even though, for small stuff like that it might be a bit more work, it's definitly worth it for bigger projects and I want to get comfortable using it.
