# RGB-Time

Have you ever wondered what time it is in RGB? No, me neither, actually.

## Why?

I'm currently learning the ins and outs of web development and I knew, I have to start getting some practical experience at some point. I thought quite awhile about what "useful" thing I can build as my first small project. Then I watched this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY and it inspired me, to think of something not quite as useful.

## The goals

  • Build a site, with a slow changing background-color
  • Make it deterministic, so everyone in the world sees the same, when they have the site open at the same time
  • Show the current color as RGB and Hex in the center, so you can copy it for your designs
  
## Why typescript?
 
 After getting into advanced stuff of js, I found out about typescript and really liked it. So I decided to use it in my project going forward. Even though, for small stuff like that it might be a bit more work, it's definitly worth it for bigger projects.
