          Have you ever wondered what time it is in RGB? Me neither, actually.

        <h3>Why did I create this?</h3>
        <p class="info__text">
          I'm currently learning the ins and outs of web development and I
          needed a project to start getting some practical experience. I didn't
          really have an idea for something useful and then I watched the video
          <a
            class="info__link"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0bsKc4tiuY"
            >Why you should make useless thing | Simone Giertz</a
          >
          and was instantly inspired.
        </p>
        <h3>So what exactly does it do?</h3>
        <p class="info__text">
          This clock does show the official RGB-Time (no, I made it up) at any
          given moment combined with the correct color in the background.
          Wherever you are in the world, the clock should show the same time for
          everyone and the same time, but chances are, you will not see the
          exact same color a second time. You can press the middle button to
          copy the current color as hex code for you design program of choice.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p class="info__text">
          It uses your system time, to calculate the current RGB-Time, The
          red-channel is switching every hour, the green-channel every minute
          and the blue one every second.
        </p>
        <h3>Is this at all useful?</h3>
        <p class="info__text">
          That wasn't really the point anyway. Still, you could argue, that
          designers could use the site for inspiration. Sometimes you just need
          a color and maybe RGB-Time has the right one for you. ;)
